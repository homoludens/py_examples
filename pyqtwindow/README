Small PyQt4 utility to help using tiled window managers from bed, with one hand :)

- it is set to autohide on the left edge of the screen - it will show itself on "mouse hover" of screen left edge
- configuration is hardcoded, but easyly changable
- it has simple calendar widget
- volume control
- wifi signal meter
- tag switcher (for mine xmonad configuration)
- easyly extendable using PyQt :)
